# Statistical Methods - Height and Weight Analysis in Children

This repository contains the code and report for a statistical analysis of the correlation between height and weight in children. The project was conducted as part of the "Statistical Methods" course at the Silesian University of Technology, Department of Automation, Electronics, and Computer Science.

## Report

The [MS_Projekt_Sprawozdanie.pdf](MS_Projekt_Sprawozdanie.pdf) provides an in-depth analysis of the collected data and includes the following sections:

- Introduction: Overview of the project objectives and dataset description
- Methodology: Explanation of the statistical methods used for analysis
- Results: Presentation of findings, including mean, standard deviation, quartiles, regression models, and assessment of model fit
- Discussion: Interpretation of results and insights into the height and weight correlation in children
- Conclusion: Summary of key findings and potential avenues for further research

## Code
